      <span class="text-original">Hello there! I'm Ark. I'm studying Computer Science, but with a twist—I'm also diving into Psychology and Business. Growing up alongside computers, I couldn't help but notice how they were changing the way we think and act. It got me curious about what makes people tick in this digital world.</span>
      <span class="text-original">As I was exploring all this, I stumbled upon that old saying from Socrates: "Know thyself." It really struck a chord with me. So now, alongside my tech studies, I'm also dipping my toes into philosophy.</span>
      <span class="text-original">I often find myself deeply affected by the world around me. It's not always easy, but it's led me to seek a deeper understanding of our shared human experience. Through philosophy, I'm learning to navigate the complexities of life, including the inevitable challenges we all face. It's a bittersweet journey—sometimes intense, but always enlightening. In a way, my unique perspective has become both my greatest challenge and my greatest teacher.</span>
